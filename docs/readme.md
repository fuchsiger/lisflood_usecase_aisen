# **LISFLOOD Use Case - Río Aisén, West Patagonia, Chile**

This use case intends to introduce the basic mechanics of the hydrological model [LISFLOOD](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-code/).<br>
The example will guide users through a set of exercises structured in X jupyter notebooks and focus from preprocessing and model setup to calibration.<br>
The notebooks are structured as followed:
1) Preprocessing (*1_Preprocess.ipynb*): 
2)
3) 
4)
5)

<br>
The test basin of the use case is located in Chile, more precisely in western Patagonia and serves as an untouched river basin particularly suitable to explore the basic functionalities and opportunities of LISFLOOD. The river under investigation is the Rio Aisén that originates from the two headwater streams Río Mañihuales and Río Simpson and has a basin size of around 11,400 km². The river terminates in Puerto Aisén and has a pluvial flow regime with minor glaciological and nival features. Elevation in the catchment goes up to more than 2,000 m. <br>
A map of the basin is shown below.<br>
